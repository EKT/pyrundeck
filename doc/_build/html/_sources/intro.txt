Introduction
============

This is the documentation for the PyRundeck library, a thin, pure
Python wrapper for the Rundeck_ API_.

Installation
------------

Right now there is no structured way to install this library, but this
will be corrected soon. For now, clone the git repository, create a
new virtual environment and install the requirements.

Acknowledgments
---------------

This library was inspired (and copied both ideas and code) from Ryan
McGrath's `Twython <https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/twython>`_ library
for the Twitter API.
